/*
 * Testing for the server was done manually. Each method within the pingball board and gadget 
 * interface was tested using junit tests. The parser also has its own testing suite.
 * Therefore, this testing strategy only tests the client-server connection, board joinings, 
 * and ball relocation via the server.
 * 
 * The following describes the manual testing strategy:
 * 
 * Single client play:
 *      Check boards run as expected (as they would in phase 1):
 *          -input file for board
 *          -default board
 *  
 * Multiple client play:
 *      Make sure that client disconnected if:
 *          -same board and same name used
 *          -different board and same name used
 *      Make sure that client stays connected if:
 *          -using same board as another client with different name
 *          -different board with different name
 *      Check boards run as expected (as they would in phase 1) for:
 *          -2 clients
 *          -2+ clients
 *          
 * Joining boards:
 *      Check for correct wall representation after wall connection
 *      AND correct wall reverts back to solid after disconnection:
 *          -h Board1 Board2, disconnect Board1
 *          -h Board2 Board1, disconnect Board1
 *          -v Board1 Board2, disconnect Board1
 *          -v Board2 Board1, disconnect Board1
 *          -h Board1 Board2, v Board1 Board2
 *          -v Board1 Board2, h Board1 Board2
 *          -h Board1 Board2, v Board1 Board3, disconnect Board3
 *          -v Board1 Board2, h Board1 Board3, disconnect Board2
 *      Check for correct reallocation with:
 *          -1 ball hitting invisible wall
 *          -2 balls hitting same invisible wall at same time
 *          -2 balls hitting connected invisible walls in different boards at same time
 *          -2 balls hitting not connected invisible walls in different boards at same time
 *      Check for no ball reallocation with:
 *          -1 ball hitting wall that was invisible wall after connected board disconnects
 *          -1 ball hitting wall that was never made an invisible wall
 *
